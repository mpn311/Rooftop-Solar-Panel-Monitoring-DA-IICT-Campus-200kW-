# ☀️ Rooftop Solar Panel Monitoring @ DA-IICT

## 📌 Project Summary

DA-IICT has a **200kW rooftop solar power plant**.  
Sensor data is collected from solar panels, including:
- Irradiance
- Voltage
- Current
- Temperature

This project focuses on using this data to **maximize solar efficiency** through:
- Monitoring
- Fault detection
- Analytics

## 🎯 Objectives

Students working on this project will:

### 1. 📈 Track Efficiency Trends
- Ingest and clean sensor data.
- Monitor power output for different panel clusters over time.

### 2. 🌤️ Analyze Environmental Factors
- Study how irradiance, temperature, and weather affect panel performance.

### 3. ⚠️ Detect Anomalies
- Use machine learning to identify:
  - Soiling (dust/dirt)
  - Shading (partial blockages)
  - Equipment faults

### 4. 📊 Visualize Trends
- Build dashboards using BI tools (like Power BI or Streamlit).
- Show panel health, energy output, and issue alerts.

### 5. 🤖 Predictive Modeling
- Build models for:
  - Cleaning or maintenance scheduling.
  - Output forecasting under different weather and usage patterns.

### 6. 🧠 Edge AI Prototyping
- Design lightweight ML models for on-device (edge) deployment.
- Focus on low-power, fast-response systems.

### 7. 💬 Conversational Assistant (Coming Soon)
- Create a simple chatbot assistant for real-time monitoring help and FAQs.
