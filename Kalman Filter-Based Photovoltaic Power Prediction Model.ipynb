    "\n",
    "This project implements a **Kalman Filter PV Power Forecasting Model based on forecasting experience**, as described in the research by Yang et al. (2021), *Frontiers in Energy Research*. It aims to predict short-term solar power generation using modeled irradiance data and correct it dynamically using real-time measurements.\n",

    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“Œ Objective\n",
    "To solve the problem of inaccurate solar power prediction under abnormal weather conditions (e.g., cloud cover) using a Kalman Filter, which:\n",
    "- Uses irradiance forecast as system state\n",
    "- Uses power output as observation\n",
    "- Applies dynamic correction to reduce error in real-time\n",

    "\n",
    "### âœ… Step 1: Hourly Solar Irradiance Forecast\n",
    "- Calculate **astronomical irradiance** (based on sun position, latitude, solar constant).\n",
    "- Adjust for **panel tilt** and **sunshine hours**.\n",
    "- Use **NWP data** to factor in **cloud cover and atmospheric attenuation**.\n",
    "- Output: Hourly ground irradiance (`Is`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### âœ… Step 2: Photoelectric Conversion Model\n",
    "- Use TRW (Luft et al.) model to compute power output from irradiance.\n",
    "- Adjust for:\n",
    "  - Temperature (`T`)\n",
    "  - Solar radiation (`G`)\n",
    "- Output: Estimated power (`P`) from irradiance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### âœ… Step 3: Kalman Filter-Based Prediction\n",
    "- State variable `xâ‚œ`: irradiance  \n",
    "- Observation `yâ‚œ`: measured power\n",
    "- Use a **3rd-order polynomial** fit for observation model.\n",
    "- Apply Kalman Filter to:\n",
    "  - Predict future state\n",
    "  - Correct based on measured power\n",
    "- Output: Real-time corrected power prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "### âœ… Step 4: Simulation & Evaluation\n",
    "- Compare predicted power to actual power (`Ppv(W)`) in dataset.\n",
    "- Use **Absolute Percentage Error (APE)** as evaluation metric.\n",
    "- Also compare performance with DBN (Deep Belief Network) method.\n",
